# algorithms
Repository of algorithms I have implemented

### Repository Structure
* Python
  * main.py is the primary driver of the algorithms
  * tests
     * sortTester.py contains test code for any sorting algorithms
  *  classes
    * sorters
      * bubbleSort.py contains the implementation of bubble sort


### Implemented in Python
* Sorting Algorithms
  * Bubble Sort

### Footnotes
This repository is meant as a side project for refining my skills as a program, the ultimate goal is to implement any algorithm I find in a variety of languages. As of now the immediate goal is to implement in Python, but the hope is to also reimplement in C++ and Java.
